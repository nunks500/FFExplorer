# FFExplorer

What is presented here is a custom Python script, using also selenium, made for the purpouses of navigating through several pages in order to determine those with 'Shop The Look'.  
All the program needs for parameters are subfolder, machine to run and maximum pages to run, and it will do the work alone. This came in need because so far all the work was manual, and as such i thought a better way to resolve the problem should be added.  
Because of anti-virus detecting as false positive problem, measures and packages were added in order to compile the program in a different manner using CX-Freeze.  
The build program can be found inside the /dist/ folder, however due to confidentiality name of machines cannot be revealed.
You can compile the program yourself

#Using CX-freeze

```bash
python setup.py build
```

#Using pyinstaller
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile script.py
```
